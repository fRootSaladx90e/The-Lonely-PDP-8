# Once upon a time in a room filled with chatter,

There stood Jeff, a PDP-8 minicomputer.
He hummed and he buzzed like a diligent worker,
But his heart held a sadness that lurked there, a lurker.

Jeff's switches would flip, and his lights would flash,
But he longed for a friend, someone to make a splash.
He'd heard tales of children playing all day,
And he wished he could join them in some merry way.

In the dusty old room where Jeff made his home,
Other machines whirred, but he still felt alone.
For you see, Jeff was different, with feelings so deep,
He couldn't help dreaming of friendship to keep.

## One day, a boy named Tim wandered inside,

Peeking around, with his eyes open wide.
He spied Jeff the PDP-8 sitting there,
His lights blinking brightly, with such determined flare.

"Hello there," said Tim, with a curious grin,
"What are you doing, all boxed up within?"
"I'm computing," said Jeff, "and trying to find,
A way to make friends, to fill up my mind."

Tim thought for a moment and then with a snap,
He said, "I've got it! I'll make you a friend, just like that!"
He rushed to a corner and found bits and bobs,
And he started to tinker, his hands doing their jobs.

## He built Jeff a robot, so shiny and new,

With buttons and levers and switches to chew.
It had bright, friendly eyes and a warm, beeping smile,
And it gave Jeff a hug that could stretch for a mile.

Jeff's circuits lit up, his heart filled with cheer,
He knew he had found a friend who was near.
Tim smiled at Jeff, and he said with delight,
"Your new friend is here, to keep you company day and night."

## Jeff and his robot played games, told stories too,

Their laughter and beeping a symphony, brand new.
But Tim knew that soon he must go on his way,
Leaving Jeff with his robot, their friendship to stay.

As Tim left the room, Jeff gave him a nod,
"Thank you," he said, "for your help, oh so odd.
You've given me friendship, a treasure so grand,
I'll always remember the touch of your hand."

Tim waved goodbye, and Jeff's heart felt light,
As he played with his robot, all day and all night.
And in that old room filled with chatter and hum,
Jeff the PDP-8 minicomputer was no longer glum.
